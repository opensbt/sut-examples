# SUT-Examples

This repository holds exemplary system under tests for testing with OpenSBT.

## Rover SUT

The `Rover SUT` is an AEB system and is developed in the fortiss Mobility Labs and provided in the FMU format.
The SUT can be simulated with the Carla simulator by replacing the launch and share folders in the `rosco` application 
by the ones provided in the `rover/rosco` folder. An example with an integrated Rover SUT for testing with OpenSBT is provided [here](https://git.fortiss.org/opensbt/opensbt-core/-/blob/main/doc/jupyter/06_Example_CARLA.ipynb).
